Select installer for Python 3.5.1 for your system (either 32 bit or 64 bit)

Download and run the installer. 
Find where python was installed (for me it was C:\Users\ecc\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35).
Add this folder to the end of your PATH environment variable. 

Within your Python folder identified above, you should have a folder called "Scripts". Also add the path to this folder (e.g., C:\Users\ecc\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35\Scripts) to the end of your PATH environment variable.  

Test your setup: open the command prompt and type "pip" to test whether this command is recognized. Now type "python" to make sure python starts. 

Now, we will install the packages needed for today's lab. 

Go to http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#rtree
and download an rtree package (either 32 or 64 bit)

Put the .whl file somewhere you can locate it, like the desktop. 

Now, open the command prompt and navigate to the folder where you saved your Rtree whl file and type "pip install Rtree-0.8.2-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl" (for whichever whl file you downloaded). 

You can test whether rtree is installed by running python and typing "from rtree import index".


Now, run the example script. From the command prompt, type "python spatial.py".
